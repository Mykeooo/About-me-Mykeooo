## ðŸš€ :partying_face: __Hey! My name is Myke, and here are some interesting things about me.__
- I love playing soccer with my friends and also played soccer overseas in England
and also started as a freshman! ðŸ˜ˆ

- I love sports I swim love the ocean am somewhat athletic and just overall love
having a good time. ðŸ‘»

- I in the future want to devolop websites and learn how to code without having
to use my notes all the time! ðŸ™ˆ

I started school over again for the second time, school what I thought wasn't for me
but now I just want to pursue my original dream which was to make websites and different
games! Thank you for listening to my short story! ðŸ™‰
